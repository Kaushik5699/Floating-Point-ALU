# Floating-Point-ALU
This is my first official project at my institute for the course Design Of Digital Systems.
This ALU is made to perform simple operations like addition multiplication subtraction and division of real numbers.
This model is presently used in most fo the systems. The model I have created is just the basic guide to a higher model. 
This model is not to be compared with the actual ALU actions and processes.
Installation Instructions
The ALU can be simulated by running the test file connected with the main file in iverilog compiler.
Test
Feel free to change the test bench file to try out any other inputs.
Language Used: Verilog C
Wave Simulator: GTKWave
Test Bench.
